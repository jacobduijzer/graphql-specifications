# GraphQL Specifications with Reqnroll

Welcome to the `graphql-specifications` repository! This project demonstrates how to test a GraphQL service built with [HotChocolate](https://chillicream.com/docs/hotchocolate) using specifications and behavior-driven approaches with [Reqnroll](https://github.com/reqnroll/reqnroll).

## Why Specifications?

Specifications provide a structured, human-readable way to define and verify your GraphQL APIâ€™s behavior. By aligning tests with clear specifications, you can:

- Ensure consistent and reliable API behavior.
- Make tests easy to understand for both technical and non-technical stakeholders.
- Promote collaboration and a shared understanding of the APIâ€™s functionality.

## Repository Features

- **GraphQL Service**: Built using HotChocolate, showcasing a sample domain.
- **Specifications**: Written in plain language to describe API behavior.
- **Reqnroll Integration**: Testing GraphQL queries and mutations against the specifications.
